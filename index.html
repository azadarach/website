        <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 100px;"> 
            Dame Vivienne Isabel Westwood was born Vivienne Isabel Swire on the 8th of April 1941, during World War II, in Tintwistle, Cheshire. 
            <br><br>
            When she was 16, her family moved to Harrow in Greater London, where Vivienne attended the University of Westminster to study jewellery and silver smithery course. She quit after just one term, and is quoted as saying she did not know how “a working class girl like [her] could possibly make a living in the art world”. After leaving the university, Vivienne decided to train to be a teacher instead. She sold her jewellery in a stall while studying, then became a primary school teacher.
            <br><br>
            In 1962, she met Derek Westwood, a factory worker in London. They married later in 1962, Vivienne wearing a dress of her own design. 
            <br><br>
            Vivienne Swire became Vivienne Westwood.

            <p style="margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 140px;"> 1965 was also the year that Vivienne met her partner Malcolm McLaren. Malcolm, born in 1946 in Stoke Newington, London, was a designer, artist and musician who was known for managing and promoting bands such as The Sex Pistols and New York Dolls, some of the first and most famous punk rock bands. Malcolm also helped popularise the punk movement, especially in Britain, through collaborating with Vivienne Westwood to create punk fashion. In 1967, Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood moved to Balham and had a son, Joseph Corré. Joseph would go on to be very successful, following in his parents footsteps and becoming a designer, co-creating the famous lingerie brand Agent Provocateur. </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 140px;">Vivienne was a school teacher up until 1971, when she decided to pursue fashion full-time. She opened a small boutique in Chelsea. They designed and made 1950’s inspired ‘Teddy Boy’ clothing, a style for those interested in rock and roll. The boutique was named ‘Let it Rock’.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 200px; margin-left: 160px; margin-right: 140px;"> In 1971, New York Dolls formed their band. They are thought to be one of the first punk rock bands in the world.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 140px;">As Vivienne’s design interests changed into zips, leather and studs, the boutique was renamed ‘Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die’ and the logo became a skull and crossbones.</p>

            <p class="text"> In response to their prosecution under the 1959 Obscene Publications Act because of their ‘provocative’ designs, Malcolm and Vivienne re-branded the shop once again, producing clothing that was even more hard-core. This was happening in the same year that punk music started to make itself known. Vivienne and Malcolm both upheld the punk ideologies which were extremely anti-authoritarianism and promoted individual liberty. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text"> Their new boutique, Sex, had the slogan 'rubber-wear for the office’, and defined the look of the punk movement. A few notable people of the movement worked there around this time, including Sex Pistols’ Glen Matlock and Pamela Rooke, who became a punk fashion icon. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text"> At the same time, The Ramones, Blondie and The Talking Heads appeared in the New York punk scene, playing in clubs like CBGB, which was very well-known for hosting punk bands. </p>

            <p class="text2"> In 1975, the Sex Pistols formed. Malcolm and Vivienne’s boutique Sex being where they formed their band and auditioned their drummer. They played their first live show at St Martin’s College of Art in London on November 6th 1975. The Sex Pistols completely revolutionised the punk rock scene with their explosive performances and rebellious political messages. They donned the clothing of Vivienne Westwood and the clothing from her shop, as Malcom, their manager, had asked Vivienne to design their outfits. </p>

            <p class="text2"> Vivienne’s shop reopened as Seditionaries, which it would be named until 1980, transforming the straps and zips of ‘obscure fetishism’ into fashion, and inspiring a D.I.Y. aesthetic. DIY - in both fashion and life - became a core value of the punk community. Punk Rock became much more popular, gathering a lot of media attention. </p>

            <p class="text3">The Sex Pistols’ song ‘God Save the Queen’ became number one in the charts but was refused airtime in Britain because of its anti-royalist message. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text3">Sid Vicious joined the Sex Pistols, bringing along his girlfriend Nancy, who would later become household names because of their destruction and codependency. A year later, largely because of them and Sid’s worsening drug problem, the Sex Pistols broke up. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text3">The disbanding of the Sex Pistols and punk becoming integrated into the mainstream left Vivienne disenchanted, not knowing what to pursue next. In 1980, the boutique was rebranded for the final time and renamed World’s End, which it is still called today.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 350px;"> Environment </h3>

            <p class="text2">Vivienne Westwood is famous for saying “Buy less. Choose well. Make it last. Quality, not quantity. Everybody's buying far too many clothes.” She was very conscious of the environment and had an immense dislike for fast fashion. Vivienne loved the punk movement because of its sustainable DIY ideals, and her brand remains one of the most environmentally conscious fashion brands to this day. </p>

        <section>

            <p class="text">Vivienne is credited with essentially creating the fashion that was linked to the punk movement, which was a very important era as it allowed people to be more free and express themselves with their fashion. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Westwood created designs that pushed the boundaries of fashion and challenged what society deemed appropriate. She helped establish punk fashion and the punk movement itself, and her and her creations will continue to be famous for their innovation and eccentricity.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text">But Vivienne Westwood's interest went beyond punk. In her long career she designed fashion for a whole range of styles. She became known not just for her contribution to punk fashion, but for her tailoring skills, attention to detail, creativity and her love for unusual fabric and silhouettes. She won many awards during her time, including British Designer of the Year Award and the Outstanding Achievement Award from the British Fashion Council. Her work can be seen in museums around the globe. Her legacy as one of the UK’s most celebrated designers will continue to inspire future generations.</p>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p3 class="text">“I did not see myself as a fashion designer but as someone who wished to confront the rotten status quo through the way I dressed and dressed others,” </p3>
